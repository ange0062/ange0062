Create a README.md file and save it in the root of your site. Inside the file include a brief description on how you created your web portfolio. This should include what challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes. Talk about what you learned by creating your web portfolio. Finally, include a list of any assets or resources you used that was not your own, including any frameworks, libraries, plugins, fonts, or images.



--> I have been working on this portfolio since 2018 - started when I was studying at Louis Riel School Division where I was challenged to pick a theme and understand in depth step by step - I loved the method and I found extremely useful especially now after my classes with Natalia - Because I can now trully understand what I am doing what I am changing - very proud of myself for know this much - still little but a lot compared to what I knew about a year ago. 

All the images are my own images - from experiences that I put myself throughout these years. 

Some of the experience from:
Toronto Film School in Production
Animation at Design School 2018
Coding now from Algonquin College
Acting - from Ages ago as adolescent. 



HOW the web portfolio was created, what techniques or technologies were used, what challenge were faced and how you over came them 
-> For this specifically was not so bad because once you get to understand what you are doing it kind goes - still quite complex but easier to the eyes, that is for sure. As I started working on this one about a year ago. I was not only interested in getting it all done (easy pieace in this case because of the template) but as a general actually reading each piece of code, putting effort to it to undersdant (again, not fully but now more clear.) to connect informations and trying to get it on how it all comes together.

WHY some design / functional choices where made, their purpose, and future implementation of the web portfolio
-> I desinged a quite different layout with bunch of pages but I kept going back to this design - from last year which I found the perfect template that would make everything consided (condensed) in one single page. Whereas, whoever is looking at it will not get lost. 

WHAT you learned from creating the web portfolio
-> Learned that it can be quite frustrating - Sometimes everything seems to be working just fine but all the sudden everything breaks due to one ->period<- that I missed in my JavaScript. This whole coding field is quite a challenge but I believe it is more about the journey. 

Hoping for the best by the End of this whole Program - Not quite there yet. 



By the way - Some specifications on pieces.

Social Media icons link to nothing because I do not have any it is just there for the purpose of this assignment.
